// public-lane — the assembly of the clean-17 PUBLIC read path, wired together in one place.
//
// The pieces are all tested on their own: shard-discovery derives the beacon/channel/thread/avatar addresses and
// the per-kind partition keys, shard-rpc reads accounts in batch and history (with source) for bodies,
// shard-reader batches accountStates and diffs cursors, and public-shard-ton-rpc-provider turns get_page + those
// bodies into authenticated posts. What did not exist was anything that put them together — the app imported none
// of it, so the whole lane was a library with no caller.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE SEAM. It stops at returning authenticated posts and a channel catalogue; what a post MEANS in
// the UI — how it renders, which thread it opens, what the feed order is on screen — is the app's decision.
//
// TWO THINGS IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO YET, both because guessing would bury a real decision in plumbing:
//   * MULTIPART ASSEMBLY. readPosts matches one message to one entry, so a post that fits one body cell (text, a
//     comment, a beacon card) is complete. How a LARGE post or an avatar splits across entries — the old
//     streamId/partIndex grouping — was NOT verified by the surface map (its §5.2), so this lane exposes the raw
//     per-entry posts and leaves grouping to the media slice that can measure it. readAvatarParts returns the
//     parts unassembled for the same reason.
//   * RANKING BY entry_count, the mandatory fix, IS done here (sweepChannelCatalog reads get_view for the live
//     buckets and sorts by entry_count), never by last_transaction_lt — a bucket touched by a StateInit-less
//     value message moves lt without any gate firing, so lt-ranking is the beacon-firehose an attacker buys for a
//     forward fee.
//
// WHY ITS OWN MODULE rather than lines in app.js: app.js cannot be tested without a browser; here the whole lane
// runs against a stub transport and a fixed clock, the way the intro lane does.
